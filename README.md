# Quick Weather Dashboard
The Quick Weather Dashboard is a solution to getting fast results about the weather in any city you can name. 
With the use of [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/), [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), this app was builts in the hopes
that those who use it can uncover its full potential for quick and reliable weather data. 

## Getting Started
This app does not require any installation prior to executing. Simply retrieve the correct link that references the application. All code is handled on the client-side.

## How to Use
Given that time is a precious resource, Quick Weather Dashboard was developed with an intuitive UX design that is easy to understand. To retrieve weather data from any city of your choosing, simply enter the city name in the search bar. Then, click 'Search'. Your results will be displayed on the dashboard to the right. 

## Features
Quick Weather Dashboard provides some valuable features:
* Search History 
   * Every search query will be stored to a button that is easy to click on and retrieve data. 
* Dark Theme
   * Quick Weather Dashboard is happy to say that we officially offer a 'Dark Mode Theme'. It is accessible on any browswer.
* Auto-complete Search (Not available on Github Pages)
   * Quick Weather Dashboard will try to anticipate what city you are searching for given the characters the user types into the search. This feature is currenly unable to function on Github Pages.
